## dbus update issue

maybe fix the ```dbus-update-activation-environment``` ,  ```/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/50-systemd-user.sh``` by putting ```sleep 1s``` above the command (ps. time limit must bigger than 1s)

for instance:

```bash
sleep 1s
/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/50-systemd-user.sh
```

*there must be another solution which i don't find it*
